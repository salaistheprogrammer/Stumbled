# Why this bot?

This bot solves one of my daily problems, even every one of us face this on a daily basis. That is, forgetting those "aha" moments and trying to recollect on a random day for to feel the same "aha" moment. That is **stumbling** upon the don't-wanna-forget-memories. It can be a text describing one of the significant moments in your life, it can be an Instagram post, it can be a YouTube video, it can be a quote that inspired you, it can be a simple lyrical line or a movie dialouge, et cetera that you don't want to forget, at the same time, you want to make sure you revisit it some day again, with this the bot helps.

# What this bot does?

Once you start with the bot on telegram, it registers you as a user in the database, once it does you can start adding your **stumbles** - the things you tend to forget but you don't want to. Once enough stumbles, which is 10 for now, are added, then everyday the bot will send you one stumble from your stumble list. There is no order to it, it is random.
